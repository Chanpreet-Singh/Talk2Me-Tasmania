Okay I see a boy in the cookie jar . I see he has the lid off . I see that he is standing on a three legged stool and he's about to depart from that three legged stool . He has one cookie in his hand handing it down to his sister and she's reaching up for it . And I think she's indicating to the boy to keep still so his mother doesn't hear what's going on . I see the mother . Uh I guess she's drying the dishes and she's not paying attention because she's uh leaving the sink run over and it's spilling all over the floor . And she must not be conscious because she's standing in it and doesn't know it . Um I think she must I think she's probably looking out the window as I take the second look . And I see apparently a couple dirty dishes on the tabletop . I see the cupboards . Uh I don't know whether they all have knobs on them or not . Doesn't look like the two where the boy and the girl are have knobs on the cupboard door . And I see outside . I see uh apparently it's a tree some shrubbery and some hedges . About it .
