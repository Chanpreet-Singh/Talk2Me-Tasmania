She's got the spigot on and the water's running . And there's her cup . She hasn't them put up yet . And he's up on the foot stool . And he's got the cookie jars . He's getting the cookie jars . She's begging him for some . Begging him for some cookies . She's washing the dishes uh she's drying the dishes . And she's got the water on in the sink . And there's her cup sitting down there . To be washed . No she has an apron on and her shoes . And the drapes are pulled back in one of the rooms . See .
