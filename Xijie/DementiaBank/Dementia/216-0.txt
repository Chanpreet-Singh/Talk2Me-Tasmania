Well there's a kid in a cookie jar . There's a girl waiting for some food . The mother spilled the water . And she's drying a dish . And a kid standing on a stool that's tilted . He's in the cookie jar . And the water is coming over the sink . And the window is open . And that's about all I can tell .
