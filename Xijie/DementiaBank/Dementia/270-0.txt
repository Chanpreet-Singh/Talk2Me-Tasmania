Okay . Well there is a little boy who has climbed up on a stool to get cookies from the cookie jar . And his sister is asking for cookies too . His mother is washing the dishes . And the water is running over the sink on to the floor . Did I say that the stool was tilted . I didn't think I had . Uh the cookie jar is open . The cupboard door is open . Hm the little girl has two different shoes on . I take it those are socks is what they are . Uh I can't even make out what this is supposed to be . The little boy looks like he is wearing two different shoes I think . I'm not sure what it is . Oh and the stool is has different length lengths of legs . I was just looking outside to see whether there was any difference . I assume that these are flowers .
