I see uh two kids up at the cookie jar one on a stool the other standing on the floor . Cupboard door is opened . Mother's washing the dishes . The water is running overflowing the sink . And uh there's two cups and a plate on the counter . And she's washing holding a plate in her hand . Curtains at the windows . The cookie jar has the lid off . Hm hm that's about it . Cupboards underneath the sink . Cupboards underneath the other cupboards . Uh kid falling off the stool . The girl laughing at him . Cookies in the cookie jar with the lid off . He has a cookie in his hand . And that's it .
