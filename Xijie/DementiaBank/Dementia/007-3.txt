Well the girl is telling the boy to get the cookies down but don't tell your mother . And the boy is also falling over off the stool . And the mother is letting the water run out of the sink . And she's drying dishes . I don't quite get that but then . Uh she has water on the floor and and basically it's kind of uh a distressing scene . Everything's going haywire . She needs to turn off the water . If she turned off the water she'd be a hundred percent better off .
