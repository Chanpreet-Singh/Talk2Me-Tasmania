Uh well the children are climbing up and he's about to fall . And he's getting cookies . And she's uh telling him to sh be quiet so mother won't hear it won't hear him getting up there . And uh he's handing a cookie down to her . She's washing the dishes . And uh for some reason she must have been upset about something because uh she is letting the water run out all over the place . Whether she's I can't believe she's upset about the kids because she hasn't seen them . Maybe she did turn and look at them and then go back to the dishes . In other words it's uh . Uh she she's deciding that if she did see them she's deciding that she's going to let them go ahead with it . But I don't think she would have let them go ahead if she saw the little boy falling . I think she would have turned . Maybe dropped her dish . But she would have gotten hold of him and saved him from being harmed in the fall . And he might just pull all the cookie jar with him when he falls too . And with the water on the floor and the cookie jar on the floor it would be a sad . Threesome but and the kitchen would be a mess .
