Well the little boy's in the cookie jar . And he's about to fall on the floor because the chair's tilted . Mom's drying dishes . She's not paying attention because the water's running over sink's running over . Water's all over the floor . The little girl I think is begging her brother to give her a cookie . I'm not sure about that . Um must be summer time because the window's open . You can see the the grass and shrubbery outside . And see a few dishes that mom has already dried .
