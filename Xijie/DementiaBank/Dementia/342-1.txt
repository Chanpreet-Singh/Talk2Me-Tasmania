Read it to you . Well the action . Well the little boy has his hand in the cookie jar . And the little girl is begging for some of the cookies . And he's teetering on the uh stool where he climbed up . And mama is washing dishes wiping them . And she is uh not watching what she is doing . And the water is overflowed on the floor . Because she's watching out the window at the uh . Am I going too fast . Looking at the beautiful lawn . Where there's a garage and some bushes and of course grass and trees . And she's so immersed in that she has allowed the water to overflow on the floor . And she still has a couple of cups and a plate to wash . Oh dear .
