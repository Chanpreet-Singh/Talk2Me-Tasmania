Wahoo ho ho . Well it's kind of a calamity isn't it . The uh mother just is . I assume this is the mother . And she's washing trying to wash the dishes and the water's overflowing . And uh the little boy's trying to get cookies out of the cookie jar on top of the cupboard . And his stool is getting away under him . And she help keeps holding her hand up waiting for another cookie .
