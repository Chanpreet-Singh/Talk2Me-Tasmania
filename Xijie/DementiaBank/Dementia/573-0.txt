Alright . The young man is stealing from the trying to get cookies from the cookie jar . And she's standing laughing at him and he's falling over . And uh mama had an accident at the kitchen sink . Either she's daydreaming or something wiping uh uh a dish . And that is overflowing the sink onto the floor and onto her feet . And uh the window is open . And there are two cups and a dish on the counter . What else do you want me to tell you . I mean what did you want me to say . What was it again . Anything that's happening . Oh . Um well the window is open . I guess there's a breeze blowing but uh that's about all I can see actually happening . Very good .
