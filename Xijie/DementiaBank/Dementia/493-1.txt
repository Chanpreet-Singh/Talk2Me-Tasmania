Well I know she's got a wreath or something there to put up maybe on a window . I don't know . And there's some uh two saucers or two dishes . And I don't know what that is . It could be uh to throw them things around . I don't know . And over here is your spigot as was your water . It must have run over . I don't know . And there's a cookie jar . The uh little boy's the getting a cookie jar . One for his sister . And he's almost upset here . So I don't know what to tell you . She's got a short apron on and a dress underneath it I think . The water's flowing over . There's two cups . And that is must be one of those they throw around .
