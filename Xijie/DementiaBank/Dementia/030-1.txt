Um there are two children a boy and a girl . The girl is standing on the floor and and the boy is reaching up into a cupboard that's open that has a cookie jar with the lid off of it . He has a cookie in his left hand . He's reaching for a second one and the stool on which he is standing has uh tipped over and he's going to fall down . The mother her back is to the um to the event and she is washing dishes while her uh sink is uh overflowing with water onto the floor . She seems to be oblivious of it . The window is uh opened looking out onto a pathway that has um a tree and shrubbery and a part of uh what might be an extension of the house or a garage . And there are curtains over the window . And there are are two cups and a saucer that she is either going to wash or has already washed . And uh this event is taking place in the kitchen . I don't know if I said that or not . And I believe that's about all that I can see .
