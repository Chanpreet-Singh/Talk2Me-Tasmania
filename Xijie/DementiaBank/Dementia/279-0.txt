Kid's stool turning over . She uh trying to steal cookies out of the cookie jar . Little girl is reaching up to grab hers . Huh . Mother's doing the dishes but let the water run over all over the floor . And she's standing in a puddle . Action . Drying the dishes . Or did I say that before before . Yeah . Kid's laughing . The other kid with the stool falling over break his neck . Hm there no action to the curtains . And grass is growing out there . I guess you can call that action . Leaves are probably blowing . The mother's in her own little world . The water's still running . Cookie jar . He's handing them out like he he made them . The chair's falling over or the stool . I think . And I think the little kid kicked it . And it pushed him over . Instead of holding him up she gave him a shove .
