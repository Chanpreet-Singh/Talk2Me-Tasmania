Well the lady's drying her dishes . That the little boy's up on a ladder reaching for cookie jar . And the little girl's down on the floor reaching up toward him . Then I see a sink the dishes cupboard . And then there's a walkway in the back . Guess I guess that's a walkway I call . The water's running over the sink . Well I said the little boy's climbing up on the cookie for the cookies .
