Oh boy . Alright . Family is in the kitchen . The mother's washing dishes . And her sink is overflowing . And she's looking out the window . And the two kids are taking they're stealing cookies off the out of the cupboard . And the boy looks like he's going to fall down and hurt himself or fall against his mother . And the girl is whispering don't make too much noise to him . She's or else she's laughing at him . They got the cookies . Alright now though the window let's see . There's a nice look outside real nice . I told you the water was running over and splashing onto the floor . And the mother doesn't seem too too affected by it . She's drying a dish or wiping it . Let's see . I guess the girl is laughing at her brother because he's going to fall . Looks like a nice house . There is a little bit of very little xxx but I don't think that's meant for this . Xxx the corner that got to the corner . So this is a corner here . And that goes back into there but that's xxx . Do you see what I'm making reference to . The carpentry .
