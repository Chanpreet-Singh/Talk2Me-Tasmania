Well I see the mother washing dishes . I see the water flowing out over the sink top . I see the boy on a stool that's about to tilt . And he's going to fall . He's trying to get into the cookie jar . The little girl has her hand out for a cookie . The water's running . Dishes are on the sink top . The lid is off the cookie jar . You want me to tell you the grass is growing open through the window . I can tell you the water is spilling out of the sink onto the floor . And they got the the window to see the outside world .
