Okay . The boy's going for the cookie jar . And a mother's washing the dishes . Hm oh . The water in the sink . Any oh do you want more . Hm oh this little girl wants the cookie . Oh he's falling off the chair . I didn't even bother looking at that one . Well the water's getting over the sink there . And there she's wiping her dish there . And she's looking out the window . Is that all .
