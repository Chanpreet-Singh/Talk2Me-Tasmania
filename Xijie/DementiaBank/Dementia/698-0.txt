Well there's a cookie jar there with the lid off . And the kid was up getting cookies . And he's upsetting . There's a water spigot here . That kid's getting cookies . See he got a handful on him . Well this is a cupboard up here . Here somebody ate and left the dish set . And this one's uh drying the dishes . This lady's drying dishes . That's a cookie jar and the little boy is on a ladder trying to get cookies .
