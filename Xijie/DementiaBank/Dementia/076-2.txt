Oh my . You mean how much or just the ones . Oh . There's the sink is overflowing while she's wiping uh uh uh a plate and not looking . The little boy is hungry . He wants to get some cookies . And he's standing on uh um a stool . And it's tipping over . And I don't know whether he's going to bring the cookie jar with him or what . And the little girl is um uh holding up her hand wanting some . And he's going to give to him . But uh I don't know if she has a finger to her mouth but . And she knows that he's going to be tipping over it looks like to me . Or maybe she's just not noticing it and making her mouth get ready for this good cookie . I don't know which way it is for the little girl . Because she's smiling . I think if she saw him falling over she'd do something to to help him so he wouldn't get hurt . I mean she'd grab it or something . But she's just looking up at him you know looking up at those good cookies and waiting for them to come to her hand . But this little finger in her mouth is . Uh I'm not quite sure what it means . I think it means that it's going to be good . Yeah . And uh I don't know whether the mother knows this is wet yet . She's thinking something else I think . I don't know what it is . What are what's what are we going to have for lunch . Or or she's got something in her mind because certainly she'd see this if she didn't hear it .
