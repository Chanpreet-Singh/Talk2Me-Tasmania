Oh boy . Wowie the boy's going up on a cookiejar to get cookies and he's falling off the jar and his sister is just wondering about it . Will he hit the bottom . Mama has an a sink that's overrunning with with uh water splashing down onto her shoes . She's in the process of drying dishes . She's looking out an open window at the same time . The cookie jar is open . And the girl has her finger to her lips . Well let me see . Uh everything that's going to happen huh . Looking out the window maybe it I don't know if it's uh the breeze blowing the curtains because the curtains look a little wee bit over the over the window blind over the window they look a little wee bit puffy . So maybe there's a slight breeze coming in the in the kitchen window . Mama's drying the dishes and she forgetting herself and the water is overflowing from the sink down onto the floor splashing into her shoes . Alright there are two cups and a plate on the counter to the right of the sink . And uh the boy well I did tell you the boy is getting ready to fall off of the chair . His sister is reaching up for a cookie getting it from the cookie jar . So what else . The the door is open of course to get into the cupboard . Xxx doing . Xxx . Three three legged stool . I would venture to say that is it .
