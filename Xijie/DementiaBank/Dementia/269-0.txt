Well I'm seeing a lot of water that isn't supposed to be where it is . A full sink with uh more water running down all the way to the floor . A stool that's going to project somebody into a fall and real fast . Getting out of the cookie jar . Uh dish washing and drying . And a girl trying to say silent so that uh they won't be caught . Two cups and a plate uh that probably are dry and then the other plate is being dried . A cupboard door that's open . That stool though I don't know what he's going to do with that . Uh I don't know what you why the sink's why the uh water's left on . It's going to make a mess . She's drying the plate or the dishes or whatever it is that she's working on . And of course that cupboard door is open . If it hadn't been opened why maybe he wouldn't have gotten his cookies . Well otherwise it's it's uh except for the two accidents it's uh not too bad . But the boy hasn't gotten down to his fall yet . That's the way with boys you know .
