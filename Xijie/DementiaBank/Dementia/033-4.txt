Okay . There are three persons in the kitchen . The little girl is instructing the little boy to take cookies out of the cookie jar on the second uh shelf of the cupboard . And at the same time his uh stool that he's standing on is about to collapse . The mother apparently is uh doing dishes and uh looking out the window . Has the faucet uh on in the sink . And the apparently the plug is in and the water is cascading over the kitchen floor . And uh it must be a warm sunny day because the window is open . And I can see the shrubbery and what appears to be the end of the house maybe a garage door . And on the counter there are dishes that the mother has either washed or has dried and uh is still washing a plate .
