Is it alright to say mother and son and daughter . Mother is wiping dishes but she's overflowing the sink bowl . Water is running on the floor . Outside I can't tell if it's a cloudy day or a great day but you can see some shrubbery and and bushes . < and the son and the tilting stool is about to fall . Taking cookies for he and his sister out of the cookie jar . So somebody's going to have some cleanup work to do . And the daughter is course reaching her left arm and hand and elbow up to get receive a cookie . But he's going to go crashing on down the floor where the water is going the suds water . I do the dishes sometimes at home . But with the dishwasher it's just pots and pans . Fry pans do our eggs in the morning . I use rubber gloves because my skin cracks around my nails . And I put bandaids and petroleum jelly Vaseline on them . Mhm . The drapes are alright . I don't see anything else xxx .
