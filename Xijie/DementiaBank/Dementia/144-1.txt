An average home that looks very much like ours at many times . And the mother is well she's spilling her water which is not very good but she's doing washing dishes and drying them . And one of the children upset the cookie jar . And that's an very average thing to go in in a home . Our home is a very it's a very active family . And so that it makes it kind of hard at our house sometime because uh there's a lot of like I said a lot of activity . Well the poor girl is spilling the water on her feet . It's going to be wet but then she'll have to struggle with that . Also there are a few more dishes left that didn't get finished . This has to be the dishes . And how that little boy fell off that stool I don't know but he did . No .
