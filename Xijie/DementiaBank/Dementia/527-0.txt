Well that boy's trying to get some cookies . And the girl's holding her hand up because he has gotten one and she wants it . And his where he's climbing up is falling over . And this girl she's washing dishes . And uh she has uh something there for the dinner . And she spilled the the uh water . And it's all on the floor going . She has a dish cloth in her hand . And the boy he's trying to get the cookies out of the jar for her . But he's going to fall over by the way the it looks . And she's spilled some water and stepping in it .
