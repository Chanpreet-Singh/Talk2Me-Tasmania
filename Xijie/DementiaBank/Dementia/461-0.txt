Cookie jar . The boy and a girl and the ladder . The uh cabinet . And the other cabinet with the sink in it or with the yes . The water coming out . The sink . The dishes on the cabinet . The lady drying dishes . The window . And you can see the trees outside the window . The curtains on the window . The water . Spilling over in the sink . I guess I mentioned the boy getting the cookies out of the jar . Oh yeah the ladder's tipping over . The boy's on the ladder and the ladder's tipping over . And the girl's reaching to get a cookie . And uh the water's flowing down on the floor . You can see the grass out on the lawn .
