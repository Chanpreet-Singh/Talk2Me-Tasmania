Well a youngster got up on his stool and he's trying to get into the cookie jar . And the little girl is already waiting for the cookies so she's standing there with her hand out . Oh my . And mother is very busy . Oy . She forgot to look at the spigots . They're still open . And the water is pouring from the sink . And she's looking at it like it's . What am I going to do now . And there's some dishes on the on the countertop . And you can see out into the yard . The curtains are nice . This little boy is on tilt though . That little stool is going to fall . She has her dish in her hand that she's drying . And she looks a little perplexed . Hm what am I going to do with all this water on the floor . Hm and there that you can see there's another house next door evidently . Looks like a house in the tree back there beyond the house .
