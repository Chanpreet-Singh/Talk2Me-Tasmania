Um mother son and daughter . The water's spilling out of the sink . She's drying the dishes . The the kids are into the cookie jar . Am I going too fast . How many you got xxx . How many you need . Oh . Uh you got the water running over . Uh and the little boy's uh going to fall because it's already slanting . What thing he's standing on . Stool . Is that all .
