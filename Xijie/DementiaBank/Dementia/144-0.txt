Well first of all the cookie jar is coming down it looks like but the little boy's climbing up the stepladder . He's falling down . And he's going to p äs pass some cookies on to his sister but I don't know if he'll make it there with them . And over here the mother spilled let the water run over which I have done lots of times . And she's going to have to get a towel and mop it up very quickly . That's about all on that one . That's similar . I mean very small . I don't know what these little gadgets are but I guess they had little . Part of the little cover yeah . Is that all on that one . I don't see anything else . Her feet may be getting wet in this in this on the floor too but outside of that that was the worst .
