Xxx . Can I look at it and tell you . Oh okay . Well there's a girl and a boy and the boy's in the cookie jar . And he's standing on a stool that's tipping over . And he's in the kitchen . And the mother's in the kitchen running the water at the sink . And the water's running over and it's all over the floor . And there are curtains at the windows . And there are cups and a plate on the uh pantry . And uh uh the the outside the window there's a path leading to a garage it looks like . And there are curtains there . And uh that's about all there .
