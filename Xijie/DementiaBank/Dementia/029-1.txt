Alright . I see the little boy stealing cookies from the cookie jar . And the little girl's uh he gave some to the little girl and she's eating some of the cookies . And I guess this is mama and she's washing the dishes . And she dropped a dish . No no she didn't drop a dish . Uh the the water that she's washing the dishes with she let run . And it's overflown overflown overflown . That doesn't that doesn't sound right . Did it uh . We forgot to turn off the spigot . And so the water is running off into the onto the floor here . And mom apparently is washing the dishes . And here's this little boy stealing the cookie cookies . He's going to going to fall because his uh the the cookies jar or the stool s the four legged stool whatever it is is is going to fall over with him and the cookie jar . And mama's drying the dishes as usual for mamas if they don't have a husband that dries them or washes them or whatever . Uh let's see now . I guess there's more things I'm supposed to see . Let's see here now . Oh uh and the the water is uh flowing out of the of the sink they forgot to turn off whoever's doing the uh the dish washing . Mom apparently here she forgot to turn off the water and the the water is spilling out over the onto the floor onto the kitchen floor . And the little girl has pushed over the chair with the boy that uh he that was reaching up to get the cookies . Uh I either he she pushed it over or he fell over with it .
