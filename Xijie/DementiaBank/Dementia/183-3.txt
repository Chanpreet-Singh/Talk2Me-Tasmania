There's a lot of things going on in the picture . The boy's falling off . And he's touching the cookie getting cookies up out of the jar handing them handing them to the kid . The lady's washing dishes . The spigot's opened . Uh water's overflowing the sink . The window's open . She's walking in the water . Cups on the counter and dish on the counter .
