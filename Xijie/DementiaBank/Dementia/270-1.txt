Alright . A boy is getting a cookie from the cookie jar . And the stool that he's standing on is falling over . The little girl is raising her hand reaching for some of the cookies he was taking . Mother is doing the dishes obviously . And the water is running all over the floor . Um hm let's see . I can't I guess or did I say the little girl was asking or reaching for a cookie too . Okay let's see . Well socks are falling down . I think that's about it .
