I see the little boy reaching up for the cookie jar but he's also on the stool which is tumbling over and he's going to be hurt . The little girl has her hand up for a cookie from the cookie jar too . The we'll call her the mother is doing dishes . And the water is splashing out of the sink . She can look out the window and see the lawn the birds in the trees . She's doing the dishes and as I said before the water is coming out onto the floor . She doesn't seem to be aware of it . And the little boy is going to get a bad fall on that stool . The water's on full force and it's coming out onto the floor .
