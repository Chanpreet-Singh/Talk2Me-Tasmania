And I will tell you what's . Oh boy . Well the little boy is reaching for a cookie . And his stool is falling over . And the little girl is begging him to give her one . And she's pointing to her mouth . She wants to eat it . Uh their mama is doing the dishes . The water's running over the sink . That's a mess . And then she's not even looking at them . Drying dishes . I think she's looking out the window . It's a nice yard out there . Two cups and and a dish finished . Xxx anything else .
