The boy's in the cookie jar but the stool is lopsided . He couldn't be standing like that . On a stool on two legs . And the mother's letting the water run over the sink . Well I assume she's already washed the plate that she's drying . I don't know what else she is . Whether that would be mistake or not . That's about all I can see there .
