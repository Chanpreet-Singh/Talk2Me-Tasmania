Oh the water is running out of the sink . Mother is calmly drying a dish . The uh stool is going to fall over and the little boy is on top of it uh getting in the cookie jar . And the little girl is uh reaching for a cookie . She has her hands to her her finger to her lip as if she's telling the boy not to tell . The curtains seem to be waving a bit . The water's running . And it's splashing on the floor . That's it .
