Oh you want me to tell you . The mother and her two children . And the children are getting in the cookie jar . And she's doing the dishes and spilling the water . And she had the spigot on and she didn't know it perhaps . Pardon me . And they're looking out into the garden from the kitchen window . It's open . And the uh cookies must be pretty good they're eating . The tair uh the chair is uh tilting and he's going to fall off . And uh the lady the mother's splashing her shoes and stockings all up overflowing the water . And there's um uh a window and curtains on the window . And I can see some trees outside there . And and there's dishes that had been washed and she's drying them . And there's some shrub out there and .
