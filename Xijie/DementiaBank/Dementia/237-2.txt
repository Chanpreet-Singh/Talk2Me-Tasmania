The uh young fellow is standing on the step ladder which is . It's a stool which is getting ready to fall . He's handing he's getting a cookie out while he's handing one to the sister . The top is falling off of the cookie jar . The girl is standing on the floor with her hand reaching up for the cookie while she has her right hand up to her mouth . I think she's telling him to watch it . He's at the cupboard with the door open . The mother has her back turned towards them . The water is overflowing from the faucet into the sink onto the floor while she wipes uh while she dries uh a dish . And she doesn't even hear or know what's going on . There the cupboard doors are closed . The window is open or closed and you can see outside . The path flowers and so forth . Now I know I'm missing something . She's standing in the water . The faucet the sink is overflowing . Two cups and a plate are there . That's all I can see .
