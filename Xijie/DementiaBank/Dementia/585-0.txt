He has nothing to hold onto there . He does have but he he's not doing it . The little girl has him interested in the cookie jar . Hm he's got what's he got on his feet . That's the only thing I can see there . Over here poor mama . She's dreaming of diamonds I guess . All the water running out of the sink .
