And the boy in the in the cookie jar . And the girl reaching up to him . The chair slanting ready to topple . And the cookie jar is open . And his the lid's in there . And the door's open . And mother's drying the dishes and standing in a pool of water it looks . Water running down from the sink . And there are some dishes on the sink . The window is open and you can see outdoors . She's I did say she was drying dishes didn't I . And I did mention the water running out of the sink . And the few dishes on the sink . And you can see the trees and the window outside . Looks like the little girl's eating a cookie and reaching up for another . The boy's really in a precarious position . He's got one hand in the cookie jar and another cookie in the other hand . He looks just about ready to tumble .
