Okay . Well the little boy was looking at that cookie jar and he started to tip over . She was uh talking with him and and wanting him to give her some cookies I guess . And he turned it's turning turning it over . I don't know whether he got hurt or not . Probably did . Because his mom is right beside him behind him and maybe she could have caught him . And the mother is washing the dishes but she let the water go so fast and so full that it's halfway down the it's all the way down . And she'll have to clean it all up . She'll have to get the little kids out so she can . Uh yeah .
