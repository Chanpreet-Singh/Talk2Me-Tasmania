Oh I see a woman drying a dish with a dish towel . I see water overflowing from the sink . The faucet is running . Um curtains hanging on the wall . The window the picture outside of a pathway and grass and hedges and looks like a part of the extension of the house . I see the cabinets below her . She's wearing shoes dress and apron . Um I see the cabinets on the far end of the wall with two children . A stool tilting with a boy on it reaching for cookies from a cookie jar on the shelf . I see the girl reaching up to him with the motion of silence to her mouth her fingers up to her lips and standing as the stool is um tilting . The cupboard door is open . The bottom doors of the cabinets are closed . Um the woman is standing in water on the floor from the spilling . There's handles um uh that I can see on two sets of cabinets . Uh the curtains are tied back by a tie . On the counter are two cups and a plate . There's two faucets and a spout .
