Well the boy is taking cookies out of the cookie jar . And he's handing one to his sister as he almost falls off his stool . And he has knocked the lid off the cookie jar . And the mother is washing dishes . And she has let the sink overflow and she's standing in a puddle . And window is open . And uh there's a view of the back of the house with a hedge and a nice walk and a grassy area . And the curtains are blowing in the wind . And she's standing in a puddle . And so that's about all .
