Little boy's stealing cookies out of the cookie jar . Little girl's whispering not to tell . His chair's going to fall . His mother's at the sink washing dishes . She's spilled the water all over . It's running all over the floor . She's drying a plate . She's uh looking out the window . The little boy's stool's going to fall . He's got a cookie in his hand . He's reaching for a second one . The mother she's looking outside and not watching the water running over from the sink . The cupboard door is open . She shouldn't be looking out the window . She's washing dishes . She's letting the water run out . I don't know what else I could tell .
