Well the kids are getting to the cookie jar . The boy . And he's giving cookies to his sister . And his kitchen stool is falling over . Him on it . The mother's drying dishes . And drops . It's no it's uh water . Water's splashing out over the sink . You want that . That's water splashing on the floor . And uh the sister's laughing getting cookies . Mother's drying dishes . And I I don't know . The spigot's open . The water's running out on the floor . That's about all .
