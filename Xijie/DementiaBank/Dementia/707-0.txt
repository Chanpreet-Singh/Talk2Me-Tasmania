Hm . The little boy is on the stool which is tipping and he wants cookies to give to his sister . He has a handful of cookies in one hand already and the little girl is eating a cookie . The mother is washing dishes absentmindedly . She let the sink run over and it's all on the floor . There's a window with you can see their driveway . Either bushes or trees and grass a big window . And a tree coming up here . And the part of the roof . And the cookie says cookie jar .
