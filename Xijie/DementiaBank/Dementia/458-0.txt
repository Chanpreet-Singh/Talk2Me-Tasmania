Oh . Huh . Which moves . Oh oh . The boy is taking a cookie uh cookies out of a cookie jar . His mama's washing the dishes . And the water is coming uh uh over the sink into the floor . And she's wiping the dishes . And as I'd said the boy is uh falling . And the girl's got her hand up to get the cookie . And what else do you want to know . Did I get it right .
