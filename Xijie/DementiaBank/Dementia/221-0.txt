You just want me to start talking . Well the little girl is uh asking her brother we'll say for a cookie . Now he's getting the cookie one for him and one for her . He uh unbalances the step the the little uh stool and he's about to fall . And uh the lid's off the cookie jar . And the mother is uh drying the dishes abstractly so she's left the water running in the sink and it is spilling onto the floor . And there are two uh there's uh look like two cups and a plate on the sink and board . And that boy's wearing shorts and the little girl is in a short skirt . And uh the mother has an apron on . And she's uh standing at the window . The window's opened . It must be summer or spring . And the curtains are pulled back . And they have a nice walk around their house . And there's this nice shrubbery it appears and grass . And there's a big picture window in the background that has the drapes pulled off . There's a not pulled off but pulled aside . And there's a tree in the background . And the house with uh the kitchen has a lot of cupboard space under the uh sink board and under the uh cabinet from which the cookie you know cookies are being removed . And is that enough .
