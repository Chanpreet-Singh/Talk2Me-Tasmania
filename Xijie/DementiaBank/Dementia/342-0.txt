I see a boy getting into the cookie jar . And he's he's very precarious . He the stool he's standing on is tipping him over . And she the little girl wants uh a cookie . And mama doesn't notice what's going on . She's too busy washing dishes . And she's too busy to see that the sink is overflowing . Oh is . You you mean the action . You just want action . She's stepping in the water . The little girl is begging for a cookie . Maybe I told you that though . Uh shall I tell you more . Just . The cookies uh uh cups and saucers and so .
