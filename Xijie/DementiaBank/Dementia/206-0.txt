Well the mother is drying the plate . And the water is running on the floor overrunning in the sink . The kids are taking cookies from the cookie jar . And on a on a high chair that looks you know to reach up to the cupboards . And the girl is receiving the cookies . The sister I suppose . The little girl . The little boy is taking the cookies and the little girl is he's handing them to her . And I'd be there eating them too because I like cookies . I'd be a uh my hand is always in the cookie jar . And the mother is drying the dishes . At the sink . The water's running over . She and she's not paying any never minds to it I guess . The floor's getting wet . She'll have to get a mop and mop it up . Oh this is crazy . Well the chair is uh the kid's going to fall from the uh the stool the high stool . That's dumping over and he's going to land on his rear end pretty soon . Those might be a couple cookies in his hand . Probably the cookie jar spilled too . He might catch that when it went to the floor . Yeah . That's about all . The sink is running over . The water's on the dripping on the floor all over the floor . The old lady will have to get a mop and mop up the floor too after she's through with washing the dishes .
