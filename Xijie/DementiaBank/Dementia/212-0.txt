The doors to cupboard are open . The woman is doing dishes . The curtains are spread . I see trees in background and along there's path plus some bushes and some other . There's a dish two cups each one one facing different the handle facing different way . The water's running out of the sink splashing on her foot is in the water . She has on an apron . She has a cloth drying the dishes . Um the the spigot's overflow the spigot's the water's overflowing . Oh some more . Oh . Well the the cupboards are at an angle to each other . The boy has shorts on . The girl has a short dress on .
