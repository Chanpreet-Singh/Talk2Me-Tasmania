Well the kid's up taking cookies out of the cookie jar . The other one's there holding her hand . The jar is going to fall . She's washing dishes and forgot to turn the sink off . Water's pouring all over the floor . Uh dishes are on the sink . And it looks like a face laying in the yard the way the grass is . Hm oh it's uh that's what we got . Kid taking cookies out of the cookie jar . The kid has her hand up after it . Mama's washing dishes . Sink's running over . And that's it . Good . Window window's open .
