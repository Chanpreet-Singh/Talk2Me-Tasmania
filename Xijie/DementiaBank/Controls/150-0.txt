Oh you mean things like the boy climbing up on the stool reaching for cookies . And the uh stool is tipping over and he's going to go falling on his lup . And his sister's talking to him and pointing . And uh the mother is wiping the dishes and the sink is spilling over and going on the floor . And did I say she's wiping the dishes . I presume there's something in the sink . It looks like the girl is laughing . The mother's standing in water . You mean things like that . Can I finish now . Good .
