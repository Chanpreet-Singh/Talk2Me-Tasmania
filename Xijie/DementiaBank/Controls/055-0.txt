A girl and a boy and a stool . Cookies . Cookie jar . Open closet . Curtains . Oh the little boy's reaching for the cookies and the stool's falling over . She's laughing I think waiting for a cookie . The mother's drying dishes . The water's spilling over . There's two tea coffee cups a saucer a plate . Let me see . The view from the outside . A tree and some shrubs . The plate she's wiping . Tea towel . Any more .
