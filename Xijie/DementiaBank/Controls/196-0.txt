Mhm . The mother is washing the dishes but not very attentively allowing the sink to overflow onto the floor . And she is drying a dish . Kids are trying to get into the cookie jar . They have managed to get into it . The boy is standing on a stool which is in the process of falling over while he's trying to hand a cookie to his younger sister who is reaching for it . The window is open overlooking a garden . The wind is blowing slightly . It's ruffling the curtains . It is summer . Or at least the grass is out and the trees are in leaf and the bushes . That's all of the action I see .
