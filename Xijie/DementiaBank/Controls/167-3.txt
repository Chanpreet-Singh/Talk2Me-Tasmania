I do I start . The children are getting into the cookie jar which is on the uh high above uh the uh sink . They have the um uh lid off the cookie jar . The boy has two in his hand and the girl is reaching up for them . And the uh stool in which he's standing is about to upset . Course the door is open into the to get the cookie jar . The uh mother presumably is at the sink washing uh dishes . And the um uh sink is running over . The water is splashing down on the floor . Uh there are two I suppose dry dishes on the uh the sink . She has one in her hand a plate that she is drying . She has it on an apron . She's standing by the sink is uh below a window with a um a path out into a a garden . Uh there are mm there's shrubbery to the left of the path . And you can see beyond that another window . And um I don't know what that is whether those are flowers or weeds . And oh uh this is part of the house . You can see the uh roof of uh maybe an l of a house and the curtains . That's about all . The curtains are drawn back .
