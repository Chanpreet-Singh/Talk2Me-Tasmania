Uh the boy is reaching into the cookie jar . He's falling off the stool . The little girl is reaching for a cookie . Mother is drying the dishes . The sink is running over . Mother's getting her feet wet . They all have shoes on . There's a cup two cups and a saucer on the sink . The window has draw withdrawn drapes . You look out on the driveway . There's kitchen cabinets . Oh what's happening . Mother is looking out the window . The girl is touching her lips . The boy is standing on his right foot . His left foot is sort of up in the air . Mother's right foot is flat on the floor and her left she's on her left toe . Uh she's holding the dish cloth in her right hand and the plate she is drying in her left . I think I've run out of . Yeah .
