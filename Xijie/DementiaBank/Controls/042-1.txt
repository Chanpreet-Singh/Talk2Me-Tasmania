Okay . Uh the little boy is on the uh stool uh which is tipping over . And he's getting into the cookie jar which is up in the cabinet . Uh the lid is off the jar . He has a cookie in one hand . He's reaching for another one . Uh the little girl has her hand up for uh a cookie I guess to take from him and one hand is up to her mouth like she's uh doesn't want mother to know . Uh mother's doing the dishes at the sink and the sink is overflowing . Uh the water's overflowing onto the floor . She's drying a dish . Uh there's uh it looks like two cups and a plate on the counter . Outside the window it looks like a path . And there's another window and some trees apparently and grass and some shrubs . And it's either I guess it's another part of the house because there's a curtain in the window . And there's curtains on her windows . I guess that's about it . She has an apron on .
