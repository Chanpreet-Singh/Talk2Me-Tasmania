The little girl's pointing to her mouth . She wants a cookie . The little boy is getting cookies and he's about to fall off his stool . The mother's washing dishes . She's wiping a plate . The faucet is running . The sink is running over . The water is running on the floor . Um the curtains are blowing . So there has to be a breeze outside . That's all I can see .
