Uh a boy with a cookie in his one hand and his hand in the cookie jar . Standing on a stool which is tipping over . The little girl's got her hand up for one . And I don't know what the hand means to the mouth . Does it mean she wants to eat . The kitchen sink is running over the water running out on the floor . The mother's drying the dishes frowning but not turning off the faucet . Uh hm two cups on the counter a plate . The mother's standing in the middle of the water . Curtains at the windows . The lid's falling off the cookie jar . I don't know what else is . I could see their cupboard's half open . That's it .
