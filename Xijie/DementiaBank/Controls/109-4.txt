Um the boy is taking uh cookies . Uh the girl is is saying . Quiet . He's he's the boy is falling off the stool . Uh the mother is drying dishes . The water is running over the sink . Um the curtains are blowing in the breeze . Um hm . The girl is putting her hand up to have him pass the cookies . Um she's drying the dishes . The water's running over . It's splashing on the floor . Well the window's open but that's not action . That's the curtain blowing right . I guess that's it . He's passing her the cookies . Did I say that . And he's taking them out of the jar .
