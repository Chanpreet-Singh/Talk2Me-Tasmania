Mother's drying the dishes . Junior's in the cookie jar handing a cookie to his little sister . The water's spilling out of the sink . The window is open . The door to the cupboard where the cookie jar is open and the the top of the cookie jar is off . Cookie jar is quite full . Mother has two cups and a dish on the sink . Looks like a nice day . Uh action we're looking for action . The kitchen stool that Junior's on is about ready to fall over . What else do we have . Uh that's all the action I see . Oh uh Sissy is holding her finger up to her mouth like . Don't make any noise or mother will turn around . I I've already said he's reaching a cookie to her and going for another one just before the stool falls down . His socks are drooping . Does that count . Uh I don't see anything outside . Uh uh the curtains don't look like they're blowing or anything . Mother's just standing looking . She's going to get her feet wet in a minute . Okay .
