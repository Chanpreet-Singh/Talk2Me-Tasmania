The boy's uh the girl's making fun of the boy . She made fun of him so much while he was stealing a cookie out of the cookie jar . And it made him trip . And he's going to fall . The mother's listening to the kids . She's drying dishes . She got the window open against a mirror . She's isn't paying attention to the sink . The sink's spilling water onto the floor . It's getting her feet wet . The curtains are open to allow uh fresh air to come in the house . There's two uh cups on the a dish on the sink . And the faucets are open and the cupboard door is open . Uh looks like it might be spring or summer out because things look like they're growing outside . Uh she has shoes on . She has shoes on . He has shoes on . She has shoes on . She has a dress dress apron shirt shorts socks socks . Uh the lid is off the cookie jar . There's uh a fancy sink cabinet over here and a fancy wall cabinet over there . That's about it .
