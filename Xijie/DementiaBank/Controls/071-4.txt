Uh badly damaged sink . Mother's drying dishes . Uh is it action if she's standing in a puddle of water . No water is running over is overflowing the sink . The window is open . It's blowing the curtain . Uh Billy's about to fall off the stool while handing cookies to his sister . That's another thing . And uh water's running on the floor as well as out of the sink . Water's running out of the faucet . Does that count too . Okay . I don't see anything else happening .
