Well the water's running over out of the sink . And the little boy is stealing a cookie . And he's about to fall off the stool . And uh the girl has her hand up to her mouth so she didn't want the mother to know what they were up to . And the window's open . And it must be nice weather because the grass is pretty high and needs cut . And the mother is daydreaming or she'd see that the water was going on the floor and she's going to get wet or is wet . And the curtains seem to blowing brisk in the breeze .
