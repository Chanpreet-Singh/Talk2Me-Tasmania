Well the mother's washing the dishes . The water's running out of the sink . The um boy is falling off the stool while he takes the cookie out of the cookie jar . The girl is gesturing for him to be quiet . The woman's standing in water . She's looking out of the window drying the dish . The lid is off the cookie jar whether that means anything . I think that's all I can see in there .
