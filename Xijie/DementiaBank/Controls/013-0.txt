Somebody's getting cookies out of the cookie jar standing on a stool . The stool's going to tip over . And the girl's saying . Shh don't let somebody hear . And the mother's drying dishes . The water's running out into the floor . Cups and plates are sitting on the counter . You can look out the window and see the shrubbery . Um the lid's sideways from the cookie jar . The door is open on the cabinet . Um mother apparently doesn't really notice well enough . Hm curtains are hanging on the window . The window is open .
