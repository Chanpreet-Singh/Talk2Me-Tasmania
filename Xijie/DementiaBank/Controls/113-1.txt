Mm the little girl is asking for a cookie . Little boy is handing her a cookie and taking a cookie and falling off the chair . Mother's washing dishes . The water's running . It's falling on the floor . And she's standing in it . Uh the wind is blowing . The curtains are ruffled . The mother's smiling . She must be deaf not to see what's going on behind her too . It's summertime . Flower er the plants are in bloom outside . That's all I see .
