Oh yes . Well uh the mother is washing the dishes . And the water is running over in the sink . And the kids little boy's getting in the cookie jar and he's about to trip over the chair . And she seems to be oblivious to everything . Guess in some kind of daze . And the little girl has her finger on her lips and . Sh don't tell mom . Um this looks looks like the mother is really kind of burned out . Or in some kind of a depression because she doesn't seem to know what's going on .
