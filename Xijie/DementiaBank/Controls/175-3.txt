The woman is drying the dishes and the sink is overflowing . The boy's getting the cookies out of the cookie jar . And the stool's about to tip over . And the girl's telling him to be quiet . Uh it's a warm sunny day because the window is open . And she looks like she's sort of in a in a daze and doesn't quite know what's going on . Could be daydreaming or daft one or the other . Is that it .
