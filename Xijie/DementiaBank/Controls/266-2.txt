Uh it's uh a kitchen scene . And the mother is doing the dishes . The children are trying to get into the cookie jar . The stool is falling over . The water is running over in the sink . The um it looks as though the window is open . And there is grass and what have you grass and trees outside . Looks like the curtains might be billowing a little . The little girl is asking the boy for a cookie . And let's see . The mother's drying the dishes . And she's standing in the water . Looks like there are a couple dishes that have already been dried sitting on the sink . I guess that's all I see . Pardon me . I might have missed it what you said . Oh I said the little boy's trying to get some cookies out of the cookie jar . And the little girl's asking for a cookie . And the stool looks as though it's going to fall over .
