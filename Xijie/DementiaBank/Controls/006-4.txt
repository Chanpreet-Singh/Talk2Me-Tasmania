Well there's a mother standing there uh uh washing the dishes and the sink is overspilling . And uh the window's open . And outside the window there's a walk with a curved walk with a garden . And you can see another uh uh building there . Looks like a garage or something with curtains and the grass in the garden . And there are dishes uh uh two cups and a saucer on the sink . And uh she's getting her feet wet from the overflow of the water from the sink . She seems to be oblivious to the fact that the sink is overflowing . She's also oblivious to the fact that her kids are stealing cookies out of the cookie jar . And the kid on the stool is going to fall off the stool . He's standing up there in the cupboard taking cookies out of the jar handing them to his uh a girl about the same age . The kids are somewhere around seven or eight years old or nine . And the mother is going to get shocked when the when the he tumbles and the cookie jar comes down . And I think that's about all .
