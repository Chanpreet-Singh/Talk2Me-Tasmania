The woman is washing dishes . She's wearing an apron . Water is pouring out of the sink . The boy is taking cookies from the cookie jar . And his sister or young girl is asking for some for her . The lid is off the cookie jar . The cupboard door is open . He is on a three legged stool which is falling uh which is tilted . There are curtains in the kitchen . There's a tree outside the window . There are shrubs . There's a walk . There are two cups on the uh sink counter . There's a plate there . And as I said the water is overflowing . It is already on the floor . There are cupboards above the kitchen counter and below . And the window is above the kitchen sink . And the mother has a short sleeve dress on has short hair and is drying the dishes by hand . Curtains on the window that you can see outside the window to the other side of the house . You can see the grass . You can see the handles on the cupboards . Anything else .
