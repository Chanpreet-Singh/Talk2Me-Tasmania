Doesn't matter where you start then right . Alright . There's uh a little boy on a uh stepstool which is tilted and he's getting some cookies . Now do you want descriptive as far as the cookie lids or or how they are or just the actions . Just the action . Okay and looks like he's trying to hand a cookie to his sister . She kind of has her finger up towards her mouth or something like she might be giggling . Uh the mother's drying dishes but the water is overflowing onto the floor . Uh I don't know the silk the sink looks like it's almost tilted . Now we should call the uh the the cup and the saucers . That's not action right is it . Uh the breeze might be blowing . The curtains look like they might be . Any other action . I don't see anything else . I just see into the outdoors but I don't see anything moving . That's about it I guess .
