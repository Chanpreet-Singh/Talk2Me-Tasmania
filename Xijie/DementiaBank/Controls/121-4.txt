The window's uh there are some dishes on the counter . Um the window is open and uh the curtains are sort of look as if they might be blowing a little in the wind . You can see the garage . Or no another part of the house . It has curtains in that window . Um the mother's mouth is a little bit open . She could be either singing or talking . Alright .
