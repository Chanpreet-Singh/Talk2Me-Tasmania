Okay . A little boy is stepping on a ladder that's cockeyed . And the ladder has it's a tripodal it isn't a ladder it's a stool . And it's a a three legged stool . And he's getting cookies out of a jar . And he's handing a cookie to the little girl who's saying shh to the mother . And the mother is wiping dishes with water running all over the kitchen floor . And oh god . Oh she's she has an open window . Uh and there are bushes in front of the uh window either in the house next door or some place else . And then there's a tree that doesn't have a trunk . Xxx . And um xxx . There are two cups and the handles are in opposite directions . And she's sort of dumb because she doesn't turn off the water . She's letting it run on her feet . And half of the kitchen cupboard doors don't have handles . I don't think xxx . And she's wiping the dish with two towels . And she isn't watching her dear darling children fall off the stool . Okay isn't that about enough .
