Um the mother's drying dishes and water's running over . She got her yeah and she drying dishes water's running over . She's standing in water . There's a sink there . Plate and a cup . Outside you can see outside there the the walkway and hedges a window tree . And uh outside the the cookie jar would have to be in the cupboard . And there's a what you call it the counter on in the kitchen . That's and the curtains . And the window .
