A boy is getting cookies out of the cookie jar . He's standing on a stool that's going to fall . The girl is reaching for a cookie . The mother's drying dishes . The faucet's running water . It's dripping out of the sink . Um spilling onto the floor . Dishes are on the uh counter . Window is open . Must be summertime . The girl is laughing . Looks like she's laughing . That's about it .
