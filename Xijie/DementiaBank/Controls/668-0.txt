Well the boy's trying to get in his cookie jar . And the stool overturns . And uh the little girl is expecting him to hand her a cookie . Uh the mother is her sink is running over . And she's standing in some of the water . And uh she's drying a dish or wiping a dish . And uh you said everything that's happening . Well the water's still running in the sink . And I said it's it's overflowing . And she's standing in the water . And that's I guess . Look somebody laying in the lawn out there but I can't uh .
