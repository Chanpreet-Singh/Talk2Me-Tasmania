The water is running out of the sink . And the kid's falling off of the stool . He's stealing some cookies . And the little girl says don't tell your mother who is standing in the water and drying dishes . Uh washing dishes I guess maybe drying them I don't know . And uh guess the water's splashing all over the floor . That kid don't fall out fall off that stool he's going to break his neck . And getting the cookies . That's about all I can see .
