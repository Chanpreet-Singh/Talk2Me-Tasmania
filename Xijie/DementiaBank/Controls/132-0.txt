That's it . Okay the boy is in the cookie jar and giving them to his sister . Mother's washing the dishes . The water's overflowing in the sink . The boy is falling off the stool . Uh the girl is eating a cookie asking for another . Uh the cover's off the cookie jar . Door to the cabinet is open . Uh the window outside is open . The yard . The mother is impervious of what's going on . She's unconscious just standing in the water and wiping the dishes . That's about it . The wind might be blowing near the curtain .
