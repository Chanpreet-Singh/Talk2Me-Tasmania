Water's pouring out of the sink . And the woman is washing dishes . The uh child is on a stool falling off as he's reaching for the cookie jar with his right hand and uh trying to hand the other cookies to a little girl who's reaching up with her left hand to get the cookie . And her right hand looks like she's almost uh trying to make a signal of silence so the mother doesn't hear it . The mother's feet are in the water as it's pouring on the floor . And the window is open . You can see a yard outside . There's a dish and cups on the sink . And the curtains are pulled back so you can see out the window . The cupboard door is open . And uh they're all fully dressed . And they have sort of a nondescript expression on their face . The woman has her mouth open a little bit . Well each one of them have their mouths open a little bit . And um that's about it .
