The action only . Okay . Let's see . There's uh a boy and a girl . The boy is getting cookies from the jar and he is on a stool . And the stall is tilted over . A catastrophe there I can see . The mother is drying dishes and has the water turned on . And her mind must be elsewhere because the water has overflowed . And I don't see anything happening outside . That's that's just about it I think .
