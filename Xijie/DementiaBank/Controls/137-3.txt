Okay . Little boy is crawling up to get in the cookie jar and is ready to fall off of that stool . The little sister's hand waiting for her cookie . And mommy doesn't know anything about it . In fact she's thinking about something else because the water's running out onto her feet . And she doesn't seem to be aware of it . And she's washing well she's drying looks like she's drying dishes but forgot to turn the faucet off . Is that right . Well then the she's standing by the window where she can look out into the yard where there's grass and the end of the house . And there are cabinets kitchen cabinets there .
