Mother is um drying the dishes and looking out the window not paying any attention that the water is spilling all over the floor and the sink . The window is open . Um the children are behind mother uh stealing cookies out of the cookie jar . And the boy has climbed up on the on the stool which is tipping over . He's getting cookies out of the cookie jar handing them to his sister . His shoes are untied . He's going to fall . Um the cupboard door is open . The lid's off the cookie jar . Uh mother's feet are getting wet . She must be in outer space that she doesn't notice all this that's going on .
