Well let's see . We have the water coming out of the spigot and the sink is stopped up and the water is going on the floor . Apparently the mother is drying a dish . We have the boy standing on a stool trying to get cookies out of the cookie jar and handing them to uh handing them to his sister probably . And he's about to fall as the stool is tipping over . And the grass is growing and uh probably . But I guess that's about the action .
