Oh goodness sakes . The little girl is saying . Be quiet because we don't want mother to know we're in the cookie jar . The boy is getting cookies and he's going to have an accident because the stool is going to go quite off .

There's nothing the matter with those dishes . I guess you could look out the window and see that . Hm I don't know Karen that's .
