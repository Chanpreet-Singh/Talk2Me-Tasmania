Everything that I see going on . Okay . Well a little boy is stealing a cookie from the cookie jar . He's also handing a cookie with his left hand to the girl . He's also falling off a stool or the stool is tipping over . The little girl is reaching for the cookie . At the same time she's picking her nose or something . I don't know what's she's doing . Uh it looks like maybe the lid is falling from the cookie jar . I'm not sure . The lady is wiping a plate while the sink overflows . And she's standing in a puddle of water . Am I going too fast . And she's looking out the window . I can't make out anything in particular going on outside . The water the faucet's turned on of course which is causing the sink to overflow . And the water is splashing on the floor . That's really about all I can tell going on so to speak .
