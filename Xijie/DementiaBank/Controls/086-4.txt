Mhm . Um a boy's standing on a stool getting a cookie out of the cookie jar . And the stool is tipping over . His sister is reaching up asking him she's asking for another cookie and he's handing it down to her . And he has one in his left hand for her and one in his right hand for himself except he's going to fall down first . Um the lid's off the cookie jar . The mother's washing drying um she's washing dishes . She's drying a plate . Somehow or she's gotten bemused and let the sink run over . The water's flowing into the sink . There are two cups and a plate on the counter . The window is open . And um it must be uh summer or you know maybe autumn because there are bushes and trees and things and they have leaves on . And um it's in kitchen . That's about . Uh oh the mother has on a dress that's just about comes to her knees . She has an apron and uh a sleeveless dress . Um little girl's in a miniskirt and the boy is in shorts . That's about it .
