Oh there's a little boy on a um stepstool about to fall . He's reaching in the cookie jar . And the little girl reaching for a cookie . And the mother washing dishes . And the sink is overflowing . And the tap water's coming in . And it looks like there might be a breeze blowing the curtains . Because the water's running on the floor . Hm . And the door of the cupboard is ajar where he has a cookie jar hm .
