I see a little boy on a stool trying to reach the cookie jar . He's got one in his hand that to his little sister . And the stool is falling over tipping . And the lady is guess mama is standing by the sink washing dishes . And the water's running over on the floor . And outside you can see the walk and the shrubbery . And there's some dishes setting on the counter . And that's all I see .
