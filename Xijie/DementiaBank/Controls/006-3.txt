Well the kids are in the kitchen with their mother uh uh taking cookies out of the cookie jar . A boy's handing it to the girl . And the boy's uh on a on a uh stool and he's tripping over . He's going to fall on the floor . The mother's standing there doing the dishes . She's washing the dishes looking out the open window . And the water's running down over the sink on on the floor getting her feet wet . And there are she's drying a dish . And there are a couple of dishes sitting on the kitchen counter . And looking out the window uh it's probably in the spring or summer of the year .
