First of all the sink is overflowing . Mother is washing dishes or an adult is washing dishes . There are two children in the cookie jar . One of them is on a stool . And the stool's overturning . The little girl is reaching for a cookie from the little boy as the stool turn falls over . There's a window . And the bushes and path outside the window . And a glimpse of another window . And another part of the house . There are curtains with tie backs . There are dishes . There is dish towels there are dish towels . Um well maybe there are only one . There's at least only one dish towel . I thought I I looked at one dish towel . Two cups a plate cabinets . Apron . Glass and trees . I don't think I can xxx . Floor . Counter space . Did I xxx .
