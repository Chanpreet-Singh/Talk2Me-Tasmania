Uh inside the room or every place . Oh I can oh you don't want me to memorize it . Oh . Okay the the little girl asking for the cookie from the boy who's about to fall on his head . And she's going I guess shush or give me one . The mother's we don't think she might be on drugs because uh she's off someplace because the sink's running over . And uh it's summer outside because the window's open and the grasses or the bushes look healthy . And uh she's drying dishes with her apron on . And the cookie jar's looking full . That's it .
