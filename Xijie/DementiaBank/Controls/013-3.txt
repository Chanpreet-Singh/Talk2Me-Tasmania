The boy's getting cookies out of the cookie jar . He's handing one to a girl . The the stool he's standing on is falling . The lady's drying dishes . The sink is running over . The water's turned on full . Um cups are sitting on the counter plates sitting on the counter . Puddle of water's on the floor . Little girl is saying . Shh don't tell anybody . And the cookie jar looks like it's ready to fall out . And the cookie jar is full clear full . That's about all I see that's going on .
