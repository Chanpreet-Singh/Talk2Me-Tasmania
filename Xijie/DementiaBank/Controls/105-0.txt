Alrightie . Uh the action I see is um a uh little girl uh with her finger up to her mouth and the one arm extended up uh looking up at the boy who's reaching up to the cookie jar . With his right hand he's reaching for a cookie . With his left hand he already has a cookie . It almost looks like the girl's trying to reach for the cookie in the lower hand the left hand . And he's standing on a stool that's tipping over . And uh looks like he's about ready to fall . The uh woman at the sink uh looks like she's washing wiping a dish with a rag in her hand holding the dish with the other hand as water's flowing into the sink and over the sink . It looks like she's not paying attention to the water just flowing out of the sink and all over the floor . And she's stepping into the water too . It's uh xxx . As far as action no action outside the window . Um that's about it .
