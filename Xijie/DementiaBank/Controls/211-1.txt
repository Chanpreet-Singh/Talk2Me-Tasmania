Do you want me to start . The water is running over . Woman is drying the dishes . The boy is climbing up and taking something from the cookie jar . The stool is turning over . The girl is laughing . Um did I say the woman's drying the dishes . The floor is getting wet . The lid is off the cookie jar . The girl is reaching . The water is running over the sink but it's also running out of the spigot . Yeah I guess that's all .
