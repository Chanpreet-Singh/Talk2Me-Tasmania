Kid's going to fall on fall off the stool getting cookies out of the jar that his sister's holding her finger up telling him don't talk and she wants a cookie . And the water's running over in the sink . And the mother's standing in the water . She's drying the dishes . And uh let's see . What do you what else you wanted to see . You want to see what's wrong with the picture . Oh oh . And uh the window's open . And uh she's drying the dishes . She has her back to the kids . The cupboard's open . Little girl's telling him not to talk to much and I guess she's not to tell on them . And that's about uh what else is there you're going to find out in that picture . I don't see anything off out in the yard . Guess it's the summer and the grass is growing and bushes look like they're growing . It looks like a towel . I don't understand the towel situation . It looks like half xxx . Oh no that's the other part of the curtain . That's alright .
