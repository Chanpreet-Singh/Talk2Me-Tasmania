Well Johnny's falling off the stool . The boy's falling off a stool after trying to steal cookies out of a cookie jar . Going to give them to his sister . The mother is washing dishes . The water's running on the floor . Window's open . The water's running . Can't think of anything uh . They're in the kitchen . The little girl's whispering or motioning to be quiet . I guess that's it .
