Well my goodness here . Little boy's about to fall off a chair while he's reaching for some cookies . And he's handing some cookies to his sister apparently . And the mother is over here . Probably the mother . Wiping a plate . Filling dishes . And meanwhile the water's overflowing out of the sink and dropping on the floor and she's standing in water . Which doesn't make sense does it . I don't see any birds on the windowsills . No action outside so that looks like that's about all the action . Girl's reaching up for a cookie . She's got her finger up her nose or to touching her nose for some reason . Can't tell if the grass is growing sorry . No no .
