Uh the sink's running over . The water's going all over the floor . Here the boy the stepladder is turning under his legs and he's stealing cookies out of the cookie jar . And she's begging for cookies the girl is . Coming back to the sink let's see here . Mama's stepping in the water . And I I said the sink was running over . She's drying dishes . Wait a minute . What the devil is xxx . There is something but I don't know what it is written on the grass it seems . What is that . And the curtains . That's a p p something there . Hm let's see . I don't see anything else there . She's stepping in the water . The sink's running over . That spells something down there but I can't see it . Xxx so far xxx . And he's on a a stool that's going to fall over while they're stealing cookies . And there's a plate and two cups on the sink and she's got a plate in her hand . I don't see anything else .
