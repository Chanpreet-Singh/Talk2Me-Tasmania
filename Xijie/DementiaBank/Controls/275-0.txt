Uh mother is drying the dishes while the water spills over the sink . Uh it looks like the wind's blowing the curtain there . She's the mother is stepping out of the water . I guess that's about it . The boy is handing the girl a cookie too . I don't know if I've said that . And she's reaching for it . The boy is um I don't want to say falling off the stool or stepping off as it's moving I . Okay . Xxx I think that's it .
