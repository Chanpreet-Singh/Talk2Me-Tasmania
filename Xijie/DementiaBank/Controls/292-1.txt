Girl is reaching up . The boy is is uh taking cookies out of the cookie jar . Uh the uh stool is tilting . Mother is washing the dishes . The water's running over . The wind is blowing the uh curtains . The mother is drying the dishes . The boy is reaching down to I guess his sister . The boy is climbing but he's going to fall . And the mother's drying the dishes . I think I said that . The water's running and running down . And that's all I see on that .
