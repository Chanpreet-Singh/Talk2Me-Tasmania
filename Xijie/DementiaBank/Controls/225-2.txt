Okay . The mother is washing or drying the dishes . The water is overflowing onto the floor . The little boy is almost falling off of the stool and is getting a cookie . And uh he's giving it to his little sister . And uh you can see the uh walk out the window . The the curtains are seem to be uh shaking in the wind . The window is open . And um a lot of water splashing on the floor . A uh woman is standing in the water . A wet floor . The uh little girl is sort of motioning uh her brother to be quiet so the mother won't know he's getting a cookie out of the jar . And she's reaching up to uh get the cookie that he's handing her . The woman has a dish cloth in her hand wiping the dishes the one dish . That's about as much as I see .
