Well . We got a faucet turned on and water's overflowing from the sink onto the floor . Grass is growing on the outside trees are growing . No indication that wind is coming in the window or that the window's open so we can't say that it might be open because it might not be . And it looks like there's a mother there who's washing or drying dishes . And uh she's standing in the water . And Johnny over there is trying to take some cookies out of the cookie jar and he's uh falling off his little stool . And he's handing a cookie while he's falling to his sister I suppose who's reaching up to get it . And looks like she's also putting a finger in her nose . But maybe she's not . I think that's about all the action . Johnny of course is reaching into the cookie jar .
