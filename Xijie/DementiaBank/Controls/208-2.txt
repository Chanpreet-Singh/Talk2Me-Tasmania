Can I start . There is a boy on the stool . The stool is tipping over . The boy is taking cookies out of the jar . Uh the cupboard is open . The girl is saying putting her finger to her mouth and also putting her hand out for a cookie . The mother is washing dishes . Water is spilling over from the sink onto the floor . And the the window is open the drapes are open . There's two cups and a saucer on the sink . And the she is stepping on the water on the floor . And she is drying the dishes . And she is looking outside at the wow at the shrubbery . The boy is handing the girl a cookie . That is all .
