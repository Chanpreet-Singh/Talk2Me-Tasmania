Oh for god's sakes . The lady is wiping dishes . The sink is overflowing . The uh boy is uh getting a cookie . He's handing another one to the little girl . The little girl is uh shushing whatever you call that um the boy because evidently they're stealing them . And sneaking them is a better word . And um they're you said happening . A verb . It has to be movement . And just including identifying things . The lady is standing in a puddle of water . And the faucet is running . And uh the window is open . And there's a house next door with curtains at the window the same kind of curtains as hers . And there's a tree in the next yard . It almost looks like it doesn't have a trunk . It doesn't start in the ground it starts in the air . Uh there's a shrub between the two yards . There are two cups on the counter one plate . The stool is crooked . She's he's going to fall over because it and it's a it's a three it's a tripod stool that is falling over not very steady . The cupboards don't have handles except one door . And the bottom ones do and the ones on the left have a different kind of handle . And can I quit pretty soon .
