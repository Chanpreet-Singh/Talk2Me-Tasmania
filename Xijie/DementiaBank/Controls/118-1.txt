There's um the two children are in the process of stealing cookies from the cookie jar . And the little girl has her finger up to her mouth to be quiet . And the stool on which the boy is standing is about to fall . And the mother must be looking out the window because the sink is spilling over with water overflowing with water . And the meanwhile she's drying the dishes . And the water is falling down onto the floor . And it's a nice day . The window's up it looks like . And it's a nice day outside . That's about all I can see on that .
