All of the action . Uh just go ahead and tell you . The mother is drying a plate . And the water's sink is clogged and there's more water going over and it's splashing onto the floor . And the the boy's falling off the stool getting cookies from the cookie jar . And the girl's putting her finger up to her lip which means I won't tell or something like that . Uh shoes are getting wet in the mother . I'm looking outside but I don't see it doing anything . It doesn't look snowy . Doesn't have too much to tell with that . That's about the all the action I see is the water spilling over and the boy falling off the stool . I don't know that snow is action . I don't see it snowing . It looked light out there . I don't know .
