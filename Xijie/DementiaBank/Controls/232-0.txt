Alright . Well like you want me tell you that reaching up the little girl's reaching up . And the boy is uh on a cookie jar giving his sister a cookie and reaching up for another cookie . And his uh stool is tipping over . And the water's running out of the sink . The mother is drying the dishes . And uh she is standing in a pool of water . And uh the girl's putting her finger to her lips to probably say not to make any noise so mother wouldn't hear . And uh that's what else would you want to know on that . There's a cup and so there's no action there . This is just laying there . You meant just where the action is . I think that's about it . The mother's her drying the dishes . Did I say that before . The water is running over . And that's about it .
