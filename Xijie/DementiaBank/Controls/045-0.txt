Cookie jar . Uh a lad standing on a stool teetering grabbing for the cookies . Sister I guess laughing at him . Mother washing dishes . Sink is overflowing . Um view of the yard and the kitchen window with its curtain . Two cups and a dish remain . Looks like they're dried . Mother standing in the overflowed water . Um her four vased two faced cabinets four doors . And a valance and the curtain . Window's half open . And there's landscaping along the wall of the uh view from the yard view of the yard . And the walkway pictured from the window . Water is running overflowing . Boy is holding a cookie in his left hand grabbing for another one with his right hand . The lid of the cookie jar is over uff off . Mother's wearing an apron drying dishes . Okay .
