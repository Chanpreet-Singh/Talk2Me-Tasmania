Just all of the action . Do you want me to describe uh everything . Or just the action . Okay . Well the boy is uh getting cookies from a cookie jar . Little girl is reaching up with her hand to receive one . Uh the boy's in danger of falling because the stool he's on is tilting . That would be all the action . Oh oh over here then . The mother is drying the dishes . The the water is running over . It's spilling on the floor . Uh she's stepping in the water . She's looking out the window instead of paying attention to washing the dishes . That's about it .
