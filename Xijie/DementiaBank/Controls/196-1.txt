Mhm . The little boy is reaching for a cookie . And he's falling at the same time because the stool has tipped over . His little sister is reaching for a cookie and I think beginning to laugh because he's falling . The sink is running over and dripping water on the floor while the mother is trying to dry the dishes . Um the window is open and the curtains are blowing in the breeze coming in from outside . The water is running in the sink . That's why it's overflowing . I also believe that the mother is daydreaming . Possibly worrying about uh something . That's it . That's all I see .
