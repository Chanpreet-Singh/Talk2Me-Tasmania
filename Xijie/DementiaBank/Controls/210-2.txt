Young boy is up at the cookie jar . He has the cookie jar opened . He's reaching for one for himself . He's handing one down to his sister . The three legged stool is coming down with him . Uh they're nicely dressed kids but uh the boy needs his socks pulled up . Mm that's all I see there . Mother I presume it's mother is at the sink . The water is running over out of sink . She's drying a dish . She's looking out the window . There are two cups and a dish I presume that's a dish that are already dry I guess and sitting on the side of the sink . Uh nicely groomed . Nice curtains pulled back . It's apparently summer outside because the window's open and it looks like shrubs are growing . You can see a window in the other part of the house . I presume that's still their house . And there's a driveway bordered with grass . And there's a tree out there somewhere that you can see part of the trunk and part of the foliage . And uh I see cabinets around the kitchen other cabinets . And that's about it .
