What do I see going on . Just just start to describe it . The girl wants a cookie . And the boy's trying to get a cookie out of the cookie jar . And the stool's falling over . And the water spigot's turned on . The water's overflowing . And the mother's doing the dishes . And uh the windows open . And uh it's spring outside something's growing . The window's open . Anything else . She's drying the dishes . Has a dress on . Her feet's in the water . The lid's off the cookie jar . And the kid has a hand on one hand in the right hand has getting a cookie and the left hand has one in . He's giving going to give it to the sister .
