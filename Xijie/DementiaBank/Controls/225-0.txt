I see a little boy on a stool almost falling over taking cookies out of the cookie jar . And the little girl is putting her finger to her mouth that she's uh to keep it quiet . The uh mother is washing dishes . She's drying the dishes and letting the water uh keep being uh keep on running in the in the sink . And then water is running over and she is standing in the sink in the water that's uh running over . Uh there's a window there she's looking at at the grass and the flowers . And the uh uh curtains seem to be shaking from the wind and the air that's blowing in . The dishes that she's through drying are sitting on the sink top . And the little girl's raising her hands for the little boy to hand her a cookie . And he has one cookie in his hand and he's going after another one . Uh he's ready to hand her a cookie . Mother is uh holding a dish cloth that she's drying the dishes with . She has a platter that she's drying . I don't see any other action .
