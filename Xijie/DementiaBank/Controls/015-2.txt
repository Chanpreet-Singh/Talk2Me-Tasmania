This is the one where I insisted the tree doesn't have a trunk and I still think that tree doesn't have a trunk . Okay what do you want me to do . Tell a . This is a tree and it if it had a trunk it would continue . This is the top sash of the window and it has to have a trunk down here and that's just grass . So what . Well what's this . Isn't that a tree . Looks like a tree to me . Okay what do you want me to . Do you all the action . Okay . There's a little boy in short pants with short sleeves who is has a cookie in his left hand handing it to a little girl and grabbing another one . And the lid is falling off the cookie jar . And the stool is upsetting . And it's a three legged stool . And the little girl is shushing because the mother is standing there in a puddle of water with the water overflowing out of the drain . And she's wiping a dish instead of the mess . And she's wearing an apron and she has on sleeveless clothes . I don't know . I could go on . There are two cups and a plate and she's drying another plate . And uh she has short hair that's parted on the left hand side . And the little boy has a high pompadour . And the little girl has long hair and a long low waisted dress . How long should I go on .
