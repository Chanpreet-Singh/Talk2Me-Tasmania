The little girl's saying . Don't tell my mother . She's reaching for a cookie . The boy's getting cookies out of the cookie jar . The lid fell off the cookie jar . The stool's ready to fall . It's slanted . The lady's drying dishes . Water's running out of the sink . Faucets are running . Um dishes are sitting on the counter . The window's open . Water's going on the floor . The lady has her back to the kids . Looks like the drapes are blowing in the wind . That's about all there is isn't it .
