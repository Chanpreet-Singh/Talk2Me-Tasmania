Well the little boy's on a stepstool trying to reach the cookie jar and he's falling . And the girl is reaching for a cookie he has in his hand . The mama's washing dishes and the sink's running over and she's drying a plate . And the sink is running over down on the floor . The window is up . And is that all . You want something else . Oh well there's a plate and two cups on the counter . Is that is that enough . I mean is that . I I don't see anything .
