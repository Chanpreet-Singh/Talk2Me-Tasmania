Well the girl is reaching for a cookie that the boy is trying to get for her while he's . Am I going too fast . While he's falling off a ladder . And the mother is washing dishes . Drying a plate . While the sink is spilling over with water that is overflown from the spigot that is still running . And water is gushing out . And the girl is signaling to be quiet not to let her mother know that the boy is getting the cookie for her . And I did say that she's drying the dish with the towel . And the water's splashing on the floor .
