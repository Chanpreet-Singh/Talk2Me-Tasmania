Do you want me to start . Alright . The boy is standing on a stool and he is slipping . And he is reaching into the cookie jar to take cookies out for him and his sister who has her hand out reaching for a cookie . She's standing there beside him . The door of the cabinet is open . Mother is standing at the sink drying a dish . Water is overflowing onto the floor . There are cups and saucers on the counter . The window is open . You can see out . The curtains look as if they are fluttering . There is a tree and a walk . And mother has her back to the youngsters . I don't believe she knows what is going on . What I see or what I see going on . Okay that's the activity .
