Okay . It's a mother washing dishes . She's left the water on . The water is running on the floor . Um there's a child reaching for cookies . He's handing a cookie to it looks like his sister . He's on a stool that's falling over . The wind's blowing . The curtains are waving . Uh the mother's looking out the window instead of at the boy . The girl's hungry and she's pointing to her mouth . She's got her hand upraised . The the floor's going to be soaked with the water . The mother's going to have wet shoes . It's running into her shoes . And that's about all I can see . The door's open for the to the cupboard .
