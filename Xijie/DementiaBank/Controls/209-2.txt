Okay . Uh little boy's about to he's getting into the cookie jar . Got up on a stool . Uh handing them off to obviously well probably his little sister but in the meantime the stool is about to fall over before she really gets any . The mother's preoccupied at the sink . She's washing dishes and she's permitting the uh water to uh overflow . So she herself is starting to stand in a panel puddle and she seems to be unaware of what's going on behind her . And obviously it's spring or summer because the plants are blooming outside through the uh kitchen window . Uh you didn't say what's wrong . I mean this is what I'm supposed to be picking out . Uh that's about it .
