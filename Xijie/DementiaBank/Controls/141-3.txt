Well the little girl is saying to be quiet to her brother . And her brother's in the cookie jar and he's falling off the chair . The mother's oblivious to all . She's washing her dishes and the water's coming out of her sink . I don't know what she's thinking of . Um let's see what we have . Anything outside . I guess those are bushes . I don't know . Okay . Nothing out there . These are okay . The dishes are okay . Let's see . How are their shoes . Their socks are alright . I don't know .
