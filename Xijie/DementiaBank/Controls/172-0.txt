Okay mother is drying the dishes but the water is flowing out over the sink onto the floor . Uh it's a pretty day outside . There's lots of flowers . There are three dishes left to wash and dry I guess . She's standing in the water . Looks dangerous . The children are getting into the cookie jar . The boy's up there on the stool and it's almost falling over . He's got one cookie in his hand . He's handing it to the little girl and he's getting another one out of the cookie jar in the cupboard . Did you say action that's going on . Uh the little girl is kind of has her hand up to . Looks like she's telling him either to be quiet or she's laughing . The mother doesn't seem to be paying much attention . She looks like she's looking out the window . The water is splashing onto the floor . That's it .
