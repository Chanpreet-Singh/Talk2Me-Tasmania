The mother is washing the dishes . The children are getting into the cookie jar . The little girl has a finger on her lip as though uh trying to uh silence the boy who is the culprit who's . He's up on a stool which is going to upset . The mother is um so busy I don't know what she's doing that she doesn't know how the um sink uh the water in the sink to overflow . It's down on the floor . She's going to be disturbed by it . Maybe she had been looking outside . I don't know . The window is up . She has a nice view of a outside . There's a little yard and a path and the shrubbery and the tree out there . And there's some dishes already wiped evidently and put up on the sink . It is a um square kitchen . Now in the sink and then the uh others . Along one side in the uh cupboards . Along the other side is the boy on that cupboard . Is that enough .
