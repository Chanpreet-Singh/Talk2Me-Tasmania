Oh I remember this one . This is great . Okay . This looks like a mama who is uh working at the sink . And actually what she's doing is looking out of the open window . It looks as though it's spring or summer outside and very pleasant . And she's sort of forgetting what she's doing and the water is running out of the sink and splashing down on the floor . She has uh uh a sleeveless dress and an apron on and she is drying a plate with a tea towel . Um the curtains are tie back curtains and it's a casement type window . On the counter we have two cups and a plate . Um below the counter we have a cupboard on each side of the uh sink and I can't see the handles where there's there probably is under the sink cupboard also . Outsuhside the window there are grass and trees . Um the lady has short hair . She's um medium height and slender . And she has slipon shoes with no ties or straps . Um while the mother is daydreaming looking out the window two children are getting into the cookie jar which is um in a cupboard which is to our left as we face the picture . The little boy has climbed up on a three legged stool which is now tipping over as he reaches for the cookie jar which is on the second shelf . The lid is off . He has one cookie in his left hand which he is handing to his sister and he's reaching for another one with his right hand . The sister is reaching up to get the cookie . She has hair that is almost shoulder length and has a slight curl to it and she also has a summer short sleeve dress on with a short skirt . Um the boy looks as though he's dressed in sneakers and socks which are kind of sloppy . He has shorts and a short sleeved shirt on . The little girl has one strapped shoes with ankle socks . She's making a um sign to her lips to say shh so he won't make any noise and let mother know that's what they're into . Mhm . Did I say they were tie back curtains they are at the window . That's all I can see .
