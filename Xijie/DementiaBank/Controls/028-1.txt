Okay . Mother is drying the dishes but the water is going out over the sink onto the floor . Ah it's a pretty day outside . Lots of flowers . There are three dishes left to wash dry I guess . She's standing in the water . Looks dangerous . The children are getting into the cookie jar . The boy's up there on the stool . And that's almost falling over . He's got one cookie in his hand . He's handing it to the little girl . And he's getting another one out of the cookie jar cupboard . Did you say action that is going on . Uh the little girl is kind of has her hand up to her mouth . Looks like she's trying to eat it or be quiet or she's laughing . The mother doesn't seem to be paying much attention . She looks like she's looking out the window . The water is splashing onto the floor . That's it .
