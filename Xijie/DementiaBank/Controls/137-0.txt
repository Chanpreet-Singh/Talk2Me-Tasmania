Hm . Xxx . This little boy has his hand in the cookie jar . He has gotten up on a stool which is tipping over . And sister is standing there uh wanting some cookies too . And all of this is uh behind the mother's back . She's washing dishes and the uh water's running over . She must be daydreaming . The water's running over onto the floor . And she doesn't seem to notice it . And there are a couple of dishes there . She must be drying the dishes . They look dried on the counter . The one in her hand I thought she had just taken out . And then back there's a yard . And a little uh sidewalk and another wing of the house through the window . And curtains curtains there she has a window above the sink which is nice . Dave Branton wrote a whole book called The window of the xxx . She said xxx I enjoy . What book did I miss . Anything . Okay .
