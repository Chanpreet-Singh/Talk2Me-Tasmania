Okay . It was summertime and mother and the children were working in the kitchen . And the window was open and there was a slight breeze blowing in . Um mother was daydreaming and forgot and left the water in the sink running and it was overflowing . Um the children were hungry and because they knew mother was distracted doing the dishes they did something they probably should not have done . And they got the kitchen stool and moved it under the cupboard where the cookie jar was . And the young boy climbed up to get a cookie . Um because he did not place his weight correctly on the stool he's about to fall and probably hurt himself because his head's going to hit the kitchen cupboards . Um it looks like the house is set in the country . And it's a large house but either that or you're seeing another house or the a wing of the house . There's grass growing a little a little path . Mother looks pretty laid back there .
