Oh I see the sink is running over . I see the stool is tipping over . Little boy's trying to get cookies out . The girl is reaching to get a cookie . The mother is drying dishes . The window's open . Xxx that's what she's washing oh she's drying dishes now . She's standing in the water . The cupboard door is open . There's a cookie jar . The brother's leaning against the cookie jar . Curtains on the window . There's some grass and some shrubbery outside the house next door . Kitchen cabinets . Oh I see three people in there a mother and little boy and a girl .
