Tell you everything that's going on . There's a little girl asking her brother for a cookie . He is on a step he's on a high stepstool reaching up high for the cookies . And the stool is going out from under him . He is going to fall . The mother is washing dishes and not paying attention . The sink the water in the sink is overflowing . She doesn't seem to be aware of it . The through the window we can see a walkway then a grassy area and another part of the house maybe a garage . There's two two cups and a plate on a kitchen counter . The cookie jar is full . And the boy has the lid off and has one cookie in his hand . That's it .
