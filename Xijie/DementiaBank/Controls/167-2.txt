Okay . Mother's washing the dishes . The sink is overflowing with water . Uh the child is falling off the stool as he gets cookies out of the cookie jar . The daughter is asking for her share . The curtains are probably blowing . The wind the wind's probably blowing . The window's open and the curtains are blowing . The she's getting her feet wet . She's wiping the dishes drying the dishes . That's about it .
