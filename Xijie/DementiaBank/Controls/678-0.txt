Well the sink's overflowing . And uh the stool's tipping over with the boy on it . He's taking down a cookie . He has one in his hand he's going to hand to the girl . And uh everything else looks like it's fixed . The woman's wiping the dishes . There's three dishes setting on the counter . A cupboard door's open of course or he couldn't get the cookies . The little girl's pointing to her mouth . And I think I mentioned that the boy he's has one cookie in his left hand and just grabbing one with his right hand .
