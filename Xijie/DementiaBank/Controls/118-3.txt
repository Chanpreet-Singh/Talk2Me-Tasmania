Uh there's a little boy's taking a cookie out of the cookie jar and giving it to his sister . And the the stool that he's standing on is going to fall . And the the mother's back is turned . And she's the water is overflowing in the sink . And uh she's wiping the dish . And uh the the window's open . And she's probably looking out the window and missing the water overflowing .
