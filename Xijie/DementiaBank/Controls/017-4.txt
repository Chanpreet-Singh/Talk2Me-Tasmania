Are you ready . Um well the sink is overflowing . Mother is standing in the water like a jerk . She's wiping the dishes also like a jerk . Um there uh the the the boy is trying to get a cookie out of the cookie jar but boy he's about to fall off the stool . His sister has her has her hand up finger up to her mouth like she's saying . Shh . To be quiet . Don't let mother know what you're doing . And he's about to hand her a cookie . But um in a few moments it's going to be like total catastrophe . Mother the reason the water's flowing out over the sink is because the water is running furiously . Um and I'm looking out through the window . And I don't see anything going on out there . Unless I don't . That's just a bush I'm presuming or a plum pudding . Um I told you the stools about to go over . In a moment there's going to be real chaos which will make what's going on in the picture look like nothing . The cookie jar is full . The lid is off the cookie jar . And the . Do you want me to tell you all of those things . The the cabinet door has just swung open . Stool is about to fall . I guess I've just told you that . With a terrible crash . Um mother is daydreaming . She doesn't even know what's going on behind her . I think that's very important and sometimes typical . Um seems to be all I can see .
