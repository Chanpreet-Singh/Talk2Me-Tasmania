Action type things . There is water coming out of a faucet into a basin which is overflowing onto the floor . The mother is drying dishes . And she's walking in the water that is flowing on the floor . Two children are stealing cookies . One of whom is up on a uh stool that is about to fall . He's removing cookies from an upper shelf in the closet . The wind appears to be blowing because the curtains appear to be you know puffed . Those are the only action things that I can see .
