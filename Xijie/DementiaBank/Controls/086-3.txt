Well a little boy has gotten up to get cookies . He's giving his sister one but in the meantime he's falling off the chair . She's reaching out for the cookie . The lid's off the cookie jar so he's in there . And the mother is washing the dishes but she's letting the sink run over . She has more dishes to do I think . Maybe not . Maybe they're clean . And outside the window it's a lovely day . And everything has leaves on it so it must be summer . And um I guess that's about it . Do you want to know about their clothes or anything . No that's it . That's all . Mhm .
