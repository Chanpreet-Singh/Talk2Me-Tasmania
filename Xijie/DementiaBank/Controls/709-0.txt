Okay . Well in the first place the the mother forgot to turn off the water and the water's running out the sink . And she's standing there . It's falling on the floor . The child is got a stool and reaching up into the cookie jar . And the stool is tipping over . And he's sort of put down the plates . And she's reaching up to get it but I don't see anything wrong with her though . Yeah that's it . I can't see anything .
