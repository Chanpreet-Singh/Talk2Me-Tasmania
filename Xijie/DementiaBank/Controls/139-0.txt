Alright . I see the little boy taking cookies out of the cookie jar and handing them to a little girl . He is falling over on the stool . She is telling him to be quiet . Uh the mother is drying the dishes and the water is spilling out of the sink . The window is opened it looks like . She is drying a dish . She is standing in a puddle of water . That's all that I see . Uh action I mean you want something unusual out of the picture . Do you want cabinets dishes two cups a dish . No . Okay yeah . Okay . I don't see anything outside .
