Okay . The boy is falling off the stool . He's taking cookies out of the cookie jar . And the girl is reaching up for a cookie . The mother is drying dishes . The water is running out of the sink the overflowing sink . The mother's standing in the water . Um the window is open . Looks like the window's open . The water is running . I don't know whether you'd consider her looking the other way or whether that would be an activity or not . She's she's not looking at the children she's looking the other way . The girl is shushing him so he won't make a noise . The door is open on the cupboards . That's all I can see . Xxx yeah .
