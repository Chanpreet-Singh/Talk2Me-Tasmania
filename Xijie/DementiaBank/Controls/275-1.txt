Okay the boy is taking cookies out of the cookie jar . The girl's reaching for them . She's apparently telling him to be quiet . He's falling off the stool . Uh mom's washing dishes while the water runs out over the sink . Um looks like the curtain might be blowing a little bit there . Uh and she's stepping out of the puddle . Um I guess that's about it .
