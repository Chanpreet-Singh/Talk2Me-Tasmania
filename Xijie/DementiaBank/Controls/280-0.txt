Oh I see the sink is running over . And I see the stool is tipping over . The little boy is trying to get cookies out . The little girl is reaching to get a cookie . The mother is drying dishes . The window's open . Did I say did I say she's washing . Oh she's drying dishes now . That's going up . And she's standing in the water . Hm . I think the cupboard door is open . And there's a cookie jar . The lid is leaning against the cookie jar . This is curtains on the window . I can see the grass and some shrubbery outside and the house next door . Kitchen cabinets . Is that it . Mhm . They'll I see three people in there a mother and little boy and a girl .
