Okay . The little boy is climbing up in the getting cookies out of the cookie jar and is he's falling . The stool's falling over . And the little girl has her hand up that she wants a cookie and he's trying to hand her one . And the door to the cabinet is open . And the mother is washing dishes . And the the dish water is overflowing in the sink and it's running on to the floor and she's standing in the water . And there's she's drying a plate or washing it . Whatever . And there's two cups and a plate on the counter top . And it looks like the window is open . And it has curtains pulled back at the window . And there's a little lane going around the house towards the back I imagine with shrubs . And you can see another window .
